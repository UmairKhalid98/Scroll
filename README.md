# Scroll
The natural scroll direction for an external mouse is different than that of a trackpad.
Changing this setting everytime I used a mouse made the process tedious, so I wrote this script that reverses the scroll direction using a keyboard shortcut.

To use the script as a keyboard shortcut, add it as a script in automator or if saved as an application, run the app in automator using a keyboard shortcut. 

PS I use option + s key to run it
